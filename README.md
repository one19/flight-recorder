# FLIGHT FINDER

### WHAT DO
run `node find-flights.mjs`
it then:
1. searches in the bounding box in our sky using airlabs
2. finds the most likely flight to be flying over right now
3. logs that into the terminal
4. writes it into a file inside our flight-finder repo for later consumption

### TODO:
1. attempt to use a flight path api to determine a better closest-approach distance, since our linear approximation is a bit poor.
2. use it alot and dial it in to find better filtering parameters for our home
3.
